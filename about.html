        <p class="p1"> What is design? That’s something I often ask myself. What matters more? Making something that looks pretty or something functional. There are plenty of examples of one or the other, and I do my best to understand what makes a “design” work. No matter how much I analyze alignment, type choices, colour theory, or scroll through Pinterest for ideas it doesn’t answer the question of where I fit into to all of this. As a young African American there are only a few pathways presented to you growing up and if you’ve been conscious for the past few decades, you can probably guess what those paths are. What happens when you don’t fit into any of those categories? What if I can’t jump high run fast or slide on a beat?  Where do I fit in? That’s a trick question. I don’t, and so far my time spent studying design has taught me that you don’t have to fit in to be a good designer. It’s actually the opposite so long as you have the knowledge and skills to back up and execute your ideas. </p>
